This was a deliverable in response to a CS50 assignment:
https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/tracks/web/homepage/

It's relatively simplistic as the assignment was only meant to develop basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, but I felt that it might be a good opportunity to teach basic website reconnaissance skills.

Feel free to modify/adapt as you please! I've already added some flags into the mix.
